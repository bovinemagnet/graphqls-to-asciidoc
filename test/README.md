## TEST README

This is a simple example of the input and output of the converter.

* The input file [schema.graphql](test/schema.graphql)
* The output file [schema.adoc](test/schema.adoc)


## Schema Source File

[schema.graphql](schema.graphql) [file](https://github.com/marmelab/GraphQL-example/blob/master/schema.graphql) found at [https://github.com/marmelab/GraphQL-example](https://github.com/marmelab/GraphQL-example).

The description text was added to make generation of the output file more expansive.

## Internal Testing

Calling your files `internal.graphqls` and `internal.adoc` will allow you to test the converter on your own files, without it wanting to go to github.
